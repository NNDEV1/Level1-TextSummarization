<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Text summarization refers to the technique of shortening long pieces of text. The intention is to create a coherent and fluent summary having only the main points outlined in the document. Automatic text summarization is a common problem in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). This project aims to solve that problem by summarizing a short piece of text that is limited to 1024 characters. The summarizer works quite well but is limited by the size of the text that can be inputted.

Here are some resources to learn about text summarization:

* [A Quick Introduction to Text Summarization in Machine Learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-quick-introduction-to-text-summarization-in-machine-learning-3d27ccf18a9f)
* [Comprehensive Guide to Text Summarization using Deep Learning in Python](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2019/06/comprehensive-guide-text-summarization-using-deep-learning-python/)
 

Results: 
* Input: *Check .ipynb*
* Output: *Check .ipynb*

### Built With

* [Transformers](https://huggingface.co)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

* *Clone git repository*
* *Make sure correct packages are installed(below)*
* *Run beginnersummarizationpretrained.pyy*
* *or optionally for easier overall usage run BeginnerSummarizationPreTrained.ipynb.ipynb in Google Colaboratory or Jupyter Notebook*

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* transformers

```pip install transformers```

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

New deep learning models are introduced at an increasing rate and sometimes it’s hard to keep track of all the novelties. That said, one particular neural network model has proven to be especially effective for common natural language processing tasks. The model is called a Transformer and it makes use of several methods and mechanisms that I’ll use in my project. Automatic text summarization is a common problem in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). This project aims to solve that problem by using transformers for summarizing a short piece of text.

Here are some resources to learn about text summarization with transformers:

* [What is a Transformer?](https://medium.com/inside-machine-learning/what-is-a-transformer-d07dd1fbec04)
* [Huggingface Transformer Tasks](https://huggingface.co/transformers/task_summary.html)
